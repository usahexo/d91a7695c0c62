#  Where to Find the Best Pinball Machines from the 70s and 80s

If you're looking for a fun and nostalgic way to spend your free time, consider playing some pinball. Vintage machines from the 1970s and 1980s offer an experience that you can't find with newer machines. Here are some tips on where to find the best pinball machines from those decades.

First, check out pinball museums. These institutions often have a large number of vintage machines on display. For example, the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas has over 150 different machines from the past four decades. If there's not a museum near you, there may be a bar or restaurant that features a few classic pinball games.

Another great place to look is online auction websites like eBay. You can often find vintage machines being sold by private collectors. Just make sure you do your research before bidding on any machine, as some may require more restoration work than others.

Finally, if you're lucky enough to live near a gaming convention, there's a good chance that at least one vendor will be selling vintage pinball machines. These events are a great opportunity to try out many different games before making a purchase.
