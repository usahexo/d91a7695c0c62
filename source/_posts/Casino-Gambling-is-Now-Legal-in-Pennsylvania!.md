#  Casino Gambling is Now Legal in Pennsylvania!

Casino gambling is now legal in Pennsylvania! On October 25, 2017, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted to approve legislation that would allow casinos to operate in the state. The vote was 105-90, and the bill now moves on to the Senate.

Under the new legislation, there would be 10 casinos allowed in Pennsylvania. These casinos would be located in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton, and nine other cities. One casino would also be permitted in each of the following counties: Adams, Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Erie, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and Washington.

The bill’s main sponsor is Rep. Scott Petri (R- Bucks County), who says that it will create tens of thousands of jobs and bring in $1 billion in new revenue for the state each year. Gambling opponents argue that it will lead to more addiction and crime rates; however, supporters believe that it will be tightly regulated and limited to those over 21 years of age.

Governor Tom Wolf (D) has said that he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk.

#  April 4, 2017: Casino Gambling Now Officially Legal in Pennsylvania

On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill that legalized casino gambling in the state. The move follows similar legalization efforts in other states, such as New Jersey and Delaware.

The new law will allow for the construction of up to 14 casinos, including seven in Philadelphia. It also permits online gambling, which is seen as a key way to attract young people to the casino industry.

Supporters of the bill say that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Opponents argue that it will lead to increased addiction and social problems.

Casino gambling has been legal in Nevada since 1931 and in Atlantic City, New Jersey since 1978. In recent years, however, casino gambling has been legalized in a number of other states, including Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

#  Pennsylvanians Can Now Gamble in Casinos!

Pennsylvania is the fourth state to allow casino gambling, but it's the first to authorize slots in all of its counties.

It will be interesting to see how this development affects the tourism industry in Pennsylvania. There are already 11 casinos in the state, but they are mostly located in the eastern part near Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

Now that slots are allowed in all 67 counties, there may be an increase in tourism dollars flowing into western Pennsylvania and the areas around Harrisburg and Scranton.

In addition to benefiting tourism, Pennsylvania officials hope that casino gambling will help to generate much-needed revenue for the state budget. The proceeds from gambling taxes will be used to fund property tax reductions, public schools, and economic development projects.

#  Casino Gambling is Now Legal in Pennsylvania – What Does this Mean for You?

Casino gambling is now legal in Pennsylvania, and this change is expected to have a number of impacts on the state’s economy. In this article, we will take a look at what this means for Pennsylvanians and how they can take advantage of the new situation.

Pennsylvania is the fourth US state to legalize casino gambling, after New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. The bill was passed by the state legislature in October 2017 and signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf shortly thereafter. The first casinos are expected to open their doors in late 2018 or early 2019.

What Does This Mean for Pennsylvanians?

The main benefit of the legalization of casino gambling is that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state government. According to one report, the industry is expected to generate $1.3 billion in annual tax revenue and create over 17,000 jobs. In addition, casino operators will be required to pay a license fee of $10 million per year.

This new source of revenue will be welcome news for the state government, which has been struggling with a budget deficit. It is also likely to benefit local businesses and property owners near the casinos.

How Can Pennsylvanians Take Advantage of This?

Pennsylvanians who are interested in taking advantage of this new opportunity can start by checking out the list of approved casinos . Once you have chosen a casino, you can visit its website to find out about its gaming offerings and how to apply for a job.

If you are not interested in working in a casino but would like to gamble, you can still do so but you will need to travel to another state that has legalized casino gambling.

#  Pennsylvania 138th State to Legalize Casino Gambling

Pennsylvania became the 138th U.S. state to legalize casino gambling on Oct. 10, 2017, as Gov. Tom Wolf signed House Bill 271 into law. The new legislation permits casinos in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Scranton, with table games and slot machines slated to start operation by January 2019.

The state’s existing 11 tribal casinos will also be allowed to offer slot machines and other electronic gaming devices, while video poker and blackjack will be added to the list of permissible table games. The measure is expected to generate more than $200 million in new revenue for Pennsylvania each year, with taxes levied at a rate of 13 percent on gross gaming revenue.

Casino proponents argued that the new industry would create jobs and spur economic development, while opponents claimed that it would lead to increased crime and social problems. Wolf said that he was confident that the casino bill would “create thousands of good-paying jobs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for our schools, hospitals and seniors”.

Pennsylvania is the fourth most populous U.S. state with over 12.8 million residents, and lawmakers had been attempting to legalize casino gambling there since 2004. The move comes amid increasing competition from neighboring states such as New York and Maryland, which have both expanded their casino industries in recent years.
