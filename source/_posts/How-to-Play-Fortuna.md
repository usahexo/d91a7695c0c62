#  How to Play Fortuna?

Fortuna is a popular casino game that can be played in a variety of ways. In this article, we will discuss how to play the game and some of the strategies you can use to improve your chances of winning.

# The Basic Rules of Fortuna

The basic rules are quite simple. The player is dealt two cards and then has the option to hold or discard one of them. The discarded card is replaced with another card from the deck and the resulting hand is compared to the dealer's hand. If the player's hand is higher than the dealer's, they win; if it is lower, they lose. In addition, a bonus payout is awarded if the player's hand contains a certain combination of cards (as shown in the table below).

Hand Type Payout Royal Flush 1000-to-1 Straight Flush 200-to-1 Four of a Kind 50-to-1 Full House 11-to-1 Flush 8-to-1 Straight 5-to-1 Three of a Kind 3-to-1 Two Pairs 2-to-1 One Pair 1-to-1 Ace/King or Ace/Queen 0.5/0.5
