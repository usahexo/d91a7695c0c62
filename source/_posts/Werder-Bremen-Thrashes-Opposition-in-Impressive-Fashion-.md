#  Werder Bremen Thrashes Opposition in Impressive Fashion 

On Saturday afternoon, Werder Bremen visited Mainz 05 and left with a convincing 3-0 victory. This was an impressive performance from the home side, who made light work of an opponent that has been tough to beat in the past.

The opener came in the 22nd minute when veteran striker Claudio Pizarro finished clinically after a scramble in the penalty area. Just before halftime, Theodor Gebre Selassie doubled the lead with a fine solo goal. After the interval, it was only a matter of time before Bremen would add a third, and that duly arrived through midfielder Maximilian Eggestein.

This result sees Florian Kohfeldt's team move up to seventh place in the Bundesliga table, just four points off the Champions League places. With performances like this one, it is not hard to see why they are considered contenders for a top-four finish this season.

#  Werder Bremen Continues Dominance of Sports Betting Lines 

Werder Bremen is a well-known soccer club in Germany. They have a long and successful history, as well as a rabid fan base. Werder Bremen is also one of the most popular teams to bet on. This is largely thanks to the tremendous European football career of their former striker, Claudio Pizarro.

Pizarro was born in Peru but played his club football in Germany for Werder Bremen and Bayern Munich. He is the all-time leading goal scorer for both clubs, as well as being the top scorer in the history of the Bundesliga. This success has continued to bring Werder Bremen plenty of betting attention over the years.

This season has been no different, with Werder Bremen currently occupying 2nd place in the Bundesliga betting odds. This is even more impressive when you consider that they are up against teams like Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayer Leverkusen. Werder Bremen has managed to stay ahead of these teams by playing an attractive and exciting brand of football.

Their fans have responded well to this style, with attendances at Weserstadion reaching new records this season. The club’s improved form has also led to an increase in sponsorship deals, which should help them financially going forward.

All of this combined makes Werder Bremen one of the most intriguing clubs to watch in European football right now. They continue to be one of the favourites on sports betting lines and look poised to do some damage in the UEFA Europa League this season.
