How did he do it?

First of all, Marty is an excellent player. He has been playing poker since he was a teenager and has become very good at reading his opponents’ moves.

Finally, Marty is a very good thinker under pressure. When things are going badly for him, he doesn’t panic but instead calmly assesses the situation and comes up with a plan to turn it around. This ability to stay calm under pressure can be the difference between winning and losing a game.

So there you have it – three reasons why this 20-year-old poker prodigy is unbeatable! If you ever get a chance to play against him, you better bring your A game!

#  Poker Phenom Continues His Dominance, Knocking Out Bayern Munich Again

LAS VEGAS - Poker superstar Phil Ivey continued his dominant form this week, knocking out German giant Bayern Munich in the semifinal of the Champions League.

This is the second time in as many weeks that Ivey has knocked out a top European soccer team; last week he ousted Spanish powerhouse Barcelona.

"I'm on a roll right now," Ivey said after the match. "I feel like I can take on anyone."

Ivey's latest victory comes as no surprise to experts, who have long proclaimed him one of the best poker players in the world. He has already won numerous high-profile tournaments, including five World Series of Poker bracelets.

What's more, Ivey is known for his dominance in heads-up matches - a key component of poker that pits player against player, rather than against the board. In heads-up play, Ivey has been known to win upwards of 95% of the time.

"Phil is just amazing when it comes to heads-up play," said professional poker player Doyle Brunson. "There's nobody better."

Despite his prowess at the table, Ivey is still relatively unknown outside of the poker world. That may change soon, however, as he continues to rack up impressive victories against some of the best teams in Europe.

Commenting on the win, Kurganov said that “It’s an incredible feeling to beat Bayern Munich. We knew we could do it, but it’s still amazing to have actually done it.”

This was not the first time that Poker Genius had beaten Bayern Munich – he achieved a similar feat in 2016. In that match, Poker Genius also played as part of a team and triumphed over the Bundesliga champions by a score of 4-2.

Since emerging onto the poker scene in 2016, Poker Genius has established himself as one of the world’s top players, winning almost $2 million in prize money. He is particularly strong in no-limit hold’em tournaments and heads-up play.
