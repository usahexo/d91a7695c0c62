#  Hollywood Casino is Just Minutes Away From Me! 

I have lived in the Harrisburg area for over 5 years and never ventured to the Hollywood Casino. I always thought it was too far away. Boy, was I wrong! The casino is just a few minutes down the road from me.

One day, I decided to finally check it out. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had never been to a casino before, let alone played any of the games. The casino is really big! It's got a lot of different gaming options and even a few restaurants.

I started by playing some slots. I wasn't really sure how they worked, but they were pretty easy to figure out. After a little while, I moved on to some of the table games. Blackjack is my favorite so I played that for a while. Then, I moved on to roulette. That was a lot of fun!

I ended up losing some money, but that was okay. It was my first time at a casino and I definitely had fun. I'm definitely going to go back again soon!
