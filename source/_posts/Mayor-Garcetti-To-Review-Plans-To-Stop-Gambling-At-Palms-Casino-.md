#  Mayor Garcetti To Review Plans To Stop Gambling At Palms Casino 
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced this week that he plans to review the city's proposal to ban gambling at the Palms Casino Resort. The move comes after Garcetti met with representatives from the casino and tribal leaders from the nearby Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, who urged him to veto the proposed ban.

Garcetti said he is still weighing whether to sign or veto the measure, but he did say that he has concerns about its potential impact on jobs and the city's economy. "I want to make sure that any decision I make doesn't have a disproportionate effect on one group or another," Garcetti told reporters. "Our economy is growing, but we don't want to do anything that would jeopardize that."

The proposed ban, which was approved by the Los Angeles City Council last month, would prohibit all forms of gambling at the Palms Casino Resort, including card tables, slot machines, and sports betting. It is seen as a response to complaints from residents in the surrounding neighborhoods, who argue that the casino has caused traffic congestion and crime.

The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians has been lobbying against the proposed ban, arguing that it could lead to job losses and loss of revenue for the tribe. In a letter sent to Garcetti this week, representatives from the tribe urged him to veto the measure, saying it would "harm our ability to create jobs and generate economic activity."

The Palms Casino Resort employs 2,000 people and generates more than $100 million in annual revenue for the city of Los Angeles. If signed into law, the proposed ban would likely have a significant impact on those numbers.

#  City Councilmember Mitch O'Farrell Calls For Action To Stop Gambling At Palms Casino 

In a city where gambling is legal, some might say anything goes, but City Councilmember Mitch O'Farrell says enough is enough.

 
"The Palms Casino has become a haven for illegal gambling and we need to take action to stop it," said O'Farrell at this week's council meeting. "This issue has been brought to my attention by residents in the area and I am committed to working with my colleagues to find a solution."

O'Farrell pointed to the casino's recent violations of state law, which prohibit casinos from allowing gambling on credit. In addition, the casino has been cited for overcrowding and other health and safety violations.

Councilmember Paul Koretz, who also represents the district where the Palms Casino is located, said he would be happy to work with O'Farrell on a solution. 
"I share Councilmember O'Farrell's concerns about the Palms Casino and am happy to work with him on finding a solution," said Koretz. "Illegal gambling is not only a nuisance but it can also be dangerous."

According to Koretz, part of the problem may be that the casino is located in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County and therefore falls under the jurisdiction of multiple agencies. 
"It's important that we get all of the relevant agencies on board so that we can address these issues appropriately," said Koretz. "I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue."

#  State Assemblymember Mike Gatto Introduces Legislation To Stop Gambling At Palms Casino 

In a press conference on Wednesday, California State Assemblymember Mike Gatto introduced legislation that would stop gambling at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.

Assembly Bill (AB) 229 would amend the state’s penal code to make it a felony for casino operators to allow gambling by anyone under 21 years of age.

"The Palms Casino is a playground for the rich and famous, and it's time for them to stop exploiting our young people," Gatto said in a statement. "This bill will make sure that casino operators are held responsible for their role in underage gambling."

According to Gatto, the Palms Casino Resort has been cited for allowing underage gambling on more than one occasion. In one instance, an underage gambler won $62,000 playing blackjack.

AB 229 has already been endorsed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling.

The Palms Casino Resort has not yet issued a statement regarding AB 229.

#  Anti-Gambling Coalition Calls On The Palms Casino To Shut Down Its Slot Machines 

Las Vegas, NV – October 3, 2018 – The Coalition to Stop Gambling in Nevada (CSGN) is calling on the Palms Casino Resort to immediately shut down its slot machines in the interest of public health and safety.

“The Palms Casino Resort should be ashamed of itself for promoting gambling addiction and contributing to the epidemic of problem gambling in our state,” said CSGN Executive Director Jeff Morrow. “We call on the Palms Casino Resort to do the right thing and shut down its slot machines.”

Founded in 2001, CSGN is a statewide non-profit organization working to reduce the negative social and economic effects of gambling addiction on individuals, families and communities.

According to a study commissioned by CSGN, there are now more than 380,000 problem gamblers in Nevada – a number that has increased by nearly 50% over the past six years. This equates to 1 out of every 10 adults in our state.

In addition to harming individual families, problem gambling also has a significant impact on taxpayers. A recent report by UNLV found that problem gambling costs Nevada taxpayers more than $400 million each year. This includes money spent on social services such as healthcare, law enforcement and homeless assistance.

“Gambling addiction is a serious public health issue that is causing immense harm to Nevadans across the state,” said Morrow. “It’s time for the Palms Casino Resort to do its part and shut down its slot machines.”

#  Activists Rally Against Gambling At The Palms Casino

On a sunny day in late October, a group of about 20 people stood protesting outside The Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Holding signs that read “Protect our youth - gambling is not a game” and chanting “Hey, hey, ho, ho, casino gambling has got to go,” the activists made their voices heard against the casino’s promotion of gambling.

The protest was organized by the Nevada chapter of Parents Against Gambling Expansion (PAGE), which is a statewide organization working to prevent minors from being exposed to gambling advertising and to keep new forms of gambling from being introduced into the state.

According to PAGE’s president, Terri Sue Morrow, casinos like The Palms are increasingly targeting children and families with their advertising. “The casinos are using every trick in the book to get kids hooked on gambling at an early age so they can milk them for their money as they get older,” she said.

Casinos argue that they are heavily regulated and that all players must be 21 or older. However, PAGE says that much of the advertising around gambling is directed at minors, and that casinos often skirt regulations by hiding their gaming areas behind curtains or disguising them as other types of entertainment venues.

In addition to protesting outside The Palms Casino Resort, PAGE also submitted a letter to the Nevada Gaming Control Board calling for more stringent regulations on casino advertising.
