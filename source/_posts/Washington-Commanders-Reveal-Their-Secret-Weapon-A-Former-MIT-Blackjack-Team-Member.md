#  How the Washington Commanders Used an MIT Blackjack Player to Win Big in Vegas

In 1985, the Washington Commanders were a top team in the United States Football League (USFL). The team was looking for an edge against their opponents and found it in a surprising place – the blackjack tables of Las Vegas.

The Commanders hired an MIT student named John Breeding to help them win at blackjack. Breeding had developed a system that allowed him to beat the casinos at their own game. He taught the Commanders how to use this system and they began winning big.

This gave the team a huge advantage on the field. They went on to win the USFL championship that year.

Breeding’s system was eventually outlawed by Las Vegas casinos, but it was a major turning point for the Commanders – they went from being just another football team to one of the best in the country.
