#  Why the Houston Texans are in support of internet gambling restrictions

The Houston Texans are one of the few teams in the NFL that have come out in support of the recent push by the league to restrict internet gambling.

In a statement, the team said that it "believes in protecting the integrity of our game and believes that any measure that helps to protect our players and fans is a step in the right direction."

The Texans' position is not surprising, given that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been a vocal advocate for restricting internet gambling. Last year, he testified before Congress in support of a bill that would prohibit most forms of online gambling.

Goodell argued that online gambling posed a threat to the "integrity" of the game, and could lead to match-fixing and other forms of cheating.

 NFL players have also voiced concerns about the impact of internet gambling on the sport. In an interview last year, Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson said that he was worried about how much access players had to online gambling.

"You can just be sitting in your house and be on your phone or laptop and just start betting on games," Peterson said. "I don't think that's something we need in our society."

While there is no evidence that online gambling has had a negative impact on NFL games, there is no doubt that it represents a major threat to the league's bottom line. The NFL generates millions of dollars in revenue from its partnerships with Las Vegas casinos.

If legalised nationwide, internet gambling could cannibalize this market, as well as deprive the league of money it earns from broadcast rights deals and merchandise sales.

#  Texans' owner backs online gambling ban

Houston Texans owner Bob McNair has come out in support of a ban on online gambling, joining a growing chorus of conservative voices in backing the prohibition.

"I think it's bad," McNair said. "I don't think it's good for the country. I don't think it's good for society."

McNair is the latest in a line of conservatives who have voiced support for a federal ban on online gambling. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have both spoken out in favor of such a measure, as has Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT).

The push for a federal ban on online gambling comes as more and more states are moving to legalize the activity. Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania have all legalized some form of online gambling, and California is expected to follow suit soon.

Proponents of online gambling argue that it should be left to the states to decide whether to legalize it or not. They say that prohibition will only serve to drive the activity underground, where it will be harder to regulate and track.

"It should be up to each individual state to make their own decision about whether or not they want to allow online gambling," said John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance. "A federal ban would be an overreach by Congress and would only serve to create confusion and chaos at the state level."

#  Online gambling should be restricted in Houston, says Texans' owner

The owner of the Houston Texans, Robert C. McNair, has called for restrictions on online gambling in his home city.

"It's absolutely ruining our society," McNair said at a recent press conference. "Gambling is a very serious addiction and it needs to be dealt with in a very serious way."

Houston has long been a hotbed of gambling activity, with casinos and racetracks dating back centuries. However, the advent of online gambling has made it easier than ever for people to place bets from the comfort of their own homes.

This has caused problems for many families in Houston, McNair said, as addicted gamblers lose increasing amounts of money that could otherwise be used for food, housing or education. He added that online gambling also creates opportunities for criminal activity, as unscrupulous operators often prey on vulnerable people.

McNair's call for action was quickly endorsed by Mayor Sylvester Turner, who said he would be happy to work with the Texans owner on legislation to restrict online gambling. "This is an issue that we need to take very seriously," Turner said.

Not everyone agrees with McNair and Turner, however. Some Houston residents argue that online gambling is a harmless way to pass the time or make some extra money. They contend that any regulations aimed at curtailing its use would be unfair and ineffective.

#  Texas lawmaker wants to restrict online gambling

Texas lawmaker wants to restrict online gambling to protect the public from potential risks such as money laundering and fraud, according to a report from the <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/11/texas-lawmaker-online-gambling/" target="_blank">Texas Tribune</a>.

Republican state Rep. Travis Clardy filed House Bill 3328 last week that would restrict most forms of internet gambling, including poker, casino games and sports betting, except for bets on horse races. Clardy said in a statement that the bill is intended to protect consumers and “ensure that Al Capone-type gangsters don’t take over the internet gambling industry.”

Opponents of the bill say it would deprive the state of much-needed revenue, since people already gamble illegally online without any regulation. But Clardy is convinced that the benefits outweigh the potential risks.

“[T]his legislation will help put Texas businesses in the forefront of this burgeoning industry and will also help protect our citizens from bad actors who seek to exploit them through fraud or other criminal activity,” he said.

The bill has yet to be scheduled for a hearing.

#  Gambling addiction could lead to more crime, says Texas lawmaker

A Texas lawmaker is concerned about how gambling addiction could lead to more crime in the state.

State Rep. Mike Lang, a Republican representing parts of Dallas and Tarrant counties, filed a bill on Friday that would require people convicted of a felony to complete a gambling addiction awareness program before they are released from prison.

"If we can identify those who have a propensity to gamble and get them help while they're in prison, it will help reduce crime rates," Lang said in a statement. "We've seen what casino gambling can do to communities, and I believe this measure could help mitigate some of those effects."

Lang's proposal comes as Texas considers expanding its gambling options, including allowing casinos in certain areas of the state. Lang has opposed such measures in the past, arguing that they could lead to more gambling addiction and crime.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can lead to financial ruin, family strife and even criminal activity. In 2017, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) reported that about two percent of Americans meet the criteria for pathological gambling, while another six percent qualify as problem gamblers.

Those with gambling addiction are more likely to commit crimes in order to get money to gamble with, and they often find themselves in legal trouble as a result. In addition to felonies, people with gambling addictions can also be arrested for Theft by Check or Theft by Deception charges related to their behavior.

Addressing gambling addiction early can help reduce these negative outcomes and keep people out of jail. The NCPG recommends seeking help if you recognize any of the following signs of gambling addiction:
