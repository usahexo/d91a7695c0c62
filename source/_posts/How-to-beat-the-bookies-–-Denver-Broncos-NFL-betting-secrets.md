One way to gain an edge on basketball betting is by understanding how the Denver Broncos play. In the 2016-2017 season, the Broncos had a record of 9-7. They ranked 3rd in the league for sacks with 52 and 1st in yards per game with 390.5. Their defense was solid, but their offense struggled, resulting in them being knocked out of the playoffs in the first round.

The 2017-2018 season has seen a different story for the Broncos. They have a 4-4 record and are currently in 1st place in their division. Their offense has been much more successful this year, ranking 5th in yards per game with 377.3. However, their defense has suffered, ranking 16th in sacks with 20 and 24th in yards allowed per game with 383.5.

What does this mean for betting on the Broncos?

If you are looking to bet on the Broncos, it is important to look at their current form and not just their past successes. The fact that they are doing better offensively this year means that they are more likely to win games, but they are also more vulnerable defensively.

#  Can Broncos make you a winner with online sports betting?

The Denver Broncos are one of the most successful and well-renowned franchises in the NFL, with a fan base that reaches far and wide. However, if you’re a new or casual NFL fan, you may be wondering if betting on the Broncos is a smart move.

In this article, we’re going to take a look at the Broncos’ odds for the 2018/19 season, as well as whether or not it’s worth betting on them. So, if you’re looking to put your money on Denver this year, read on!

The Broncos’ Odds for 2018/19

At the time of writing, the Broncos have been given odds of 20/1 by sports betting site Betway to win Super Bowl LIII. This puts them in good stead for the upcoming season but doesn’t make them outright favourites.

As things stand, the New England Patriots are currently sitting at 2/1 favourites to win the big game, while the Los Angeles Rams are close behind at 11/2. The Atlanta Falcons are also worth keeping an eye on, with odds of 14/1.

So, is betting on Denver a good idea?


On one hand, 20/1 seems like pretty good value when you consider that they finished last season with a 5-11 record. However, they did lose their starting quarterback Case Keenum this offseason and it remains to be seen who will take his place. On paper, at least, they don’t seem to have made any major improvements to their roster.

All things considered, we wouldn’t recommend betting on Denver this season – there are simply too many unknowns at this point in time. If you do choose to bet on them though, make sure you do your research first!
