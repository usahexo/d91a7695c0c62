#  How many points is a king in blackjack? In Niue, it's worth 0 points!

In most blackjack games, the king is worth 10 points. However, in the game of Niue, the king is worth 0 points. This unique variation of the classic card game was created by the Niuean people and is now played in a few different countries around the world.

The game of Niue is a bit different than other blackjack variations. In addition to kings being worth 0 points, queens are also worth 0 points. Aces are still worth 1 point, and all other cards are worth their face value. The goal of the game is to reach 21 points without going over.

To win, players must first reach or exceed 21 points. If they go over 21 points, they automatically lose the hand. If both players have over 21 points at the end of a hand, the player with the higher number wins. In case of a tie, the hand is considered a push and no one wins or loses money.

The game of Niue can be played with 2-6 players. One player is chosen to be the dealer, and the rest of the players sit around the table clockwise. The dealer shuffles the cards and deals two cards to each player, face down. The dealer also deals two cards face up - one at the top of the deck and one at the bottom. These are called 'the burn cards'.

The player to dealer's left starts off by playing either their two cards as one hand (known as 'standing') or splitting them into two hands (known as 'splitting'). If they choose to stand, they end their turn and play passes to the next player clockwise who then has two options - either stand or split. If a player splits their cards, they play each card as its own hand and must place a second bet equal to their original bet.

When all players have had a turn, the dealer will turn over their remaining two cards. If these add up to more than 21 points, the dealer busts and everyone else automatically wins regardless of what their own hand score is. If neither of dealer's cards add up to more than 21 points (a so-called 'hard' 17), then they must take another card ("hit"). When they have decided on what action to take for all five of their cards (two from their hand and three from the burn cards), play passes back to the left for another turn.

The winner is either: 

a) The first person who gets to exactly 21 points; 
b) The person with more points than anyone else when someone goes bust; or 
c) The person who last stood (or didn't split).

#  How to Play Blackjack in Niue: The King is Worth 0 Points

In the game of blackjack, the king is worth 0 points. That means that if you are dealt a king as your first card, you do not get an extra point for that card. In fact, the king is worth the same as any other card in the deck.

Why is this the case? Well, there are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that the king was originally worth 0 points because it was thought to be less valuable than other cards. Another possibility is that the king was worth 0 points because it was easier for players to keep track of which cards were still in play when the king was worth 0 points.

Whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that the king is worth 0 points in blackjack. This can be important to remember if you are playing blackjack in Niue, where the king is actually worth 1 point. If you are unaware of this rule difference, you could end up losing a lot of money!

#  Blackjack in Niue: The King is Worthless

King Cards are Worthless in Blackjack

If you're playing blackjack and see a king card, don't get excited. That king is worthless. In fact, every blackjack game has a specific set of cards that are worth nothing. Called "dead cards," these cards don't contribute to your hand in any way and can't be used to form any potential winning combinations.

The dead cards in blackjack can vary depending on the game, but typically include all the face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) as well as the two through six suits. So if you're dealt a king card, it's basically like you've drawn a blank. You can't use it to form any type of combination and it won't help you win the hand.

While the king may be worthless in blackjack, that doesn't mean it's not still an important card. It still helps to create different hands and can be helpful when trying to beat the dealer. Just don't expect it to do anything special when it comes to winning the game.

#  In Niue, the King is Worthless in Blackjack

In the game of blackjack, the king is one of the weakest cards. It has a value of only 10 points, which is lower than both the ace and the number 10 card. As a result, the king is generally not worth very much in the game.

In Niue, however, things are a bit different. In Niuean blackjack (which is similar to but not exactly the same as American blackjack), the king is actually quite valuable. In fact, it is often worth more than the ace.

This can be quite confusing for players who are used to playing American blackjack. In American blackjack, the ace is always worth 1 point, no matter what other cards are in the player's hand. But in Niuean blackjack, an ace can sometimes be worth 11 points, depending on what other cards are out on the table.

This difference can lead to some big swings in the game. For example, if an ace and a king are both among the player's cards, the player would normally have a total of 21 points. But in Niuean blackjack, that total would be increased to 32 points! Conversely, if an ace and a two are among the player's cards, the total would be reduced from 22 points down to 10 points.

The upside of this difference is that it gives players a bit more flexibility when trying to hit or stand on particular hands. The downside is that it can be confusing for those who are not used to playing this variant of blackjack.

#  Why the King is Worthless in Blackjack in Niue

A lot of people mistakenly believe that the king is a powerful card in blackjack. In fact, the king is usually one of the weakest cards in the game. This article will explain why this is the case and why you should avoid playing blackjack with the king as your hand.

The first reason why the king is worthless in blackjack is because it offers no value to the player. The other face cards - Queen, Jack, and Ace - offer a single point each. However, the King offers no value and simply takes up space in your hand. This can be important during moments when you need to make strategic decisions about which cards to keep and which ones to discard.

Second, while the King may offer some protection against low-value cards (such as 2s through 6s), it provides no protection against high-value cards (such as 10s and Aces). Thus, if you are holding a King and an Ace, for example, your opponent has a good chance of beating you with another Ace.

Finally, in most versions of blackjack, the King only counts as 1 point when used to form a winning hand. This means that it is not as valuable as other hands such as two Queens or two Aces.

In conclusion, while the King may have some minor benefits in blackjack, it is generally not worth including in your hand. There are much better cards to play with and you are likely to see better results by avoiding the King altogether.
