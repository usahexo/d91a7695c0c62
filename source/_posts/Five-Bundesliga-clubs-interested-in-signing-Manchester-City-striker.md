#  Five Bundesliga clubs interested in signing Manchester City striker

Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim, Borussia Monchengladbach and Wolfsburg are all interested in signing Manchester City striker Leroy Sane this summer, according to reports.

Sane had a disappointing season at Manchester City last year, scoring just nine goals in all competitions. Pep Guardiola is believed to be willing to let the German international leave this summer, and it now looks like he could be on his way to the Bundesliga.

Dortmund are believed to be leading the race for Sane’s signature, but they face competition from the other German clubs. RB Leipzig are also believed to be keen on signing him, while Hoffenheim and Monchengladbach are both interested in taking him on loan for next season.

Wolfsburg are the only club in the Bundesliga who can afford to sign Sane outright, but they may not want to pay his £135 million price tag.

Manchester City are likely to want to recoup most of the £37 million they paid Schalke for Sane two years ago, so any deal is likely to be in the region of £30-35 million.

#  RB Leipzig want to bring in £30 million rated winger

RB Leipzig are keen to bring in £30 million rated winger Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund, according to reports.

Pulisic is one of the most highly rated young players in Europe and has been linked with a number of top clubs in the past.

However, it looks like RB Leipzig are currently leading the race to sign him and they are willing to pay up to £30 million for his services.

Dortmund are likely to be reluctant to sell one of their prized assets, but they may be forced to cash in if an offer of around £30 million is made.

Pulisic has already shown that he is capable of playing at the highest level, having scored five goals and provided six assists in 19 appearances for Dortmund this season.

He also has three goals in six caps for the United States national team and looks destined for a bright future.

RB Leipzig have impressed in their first season in the Bundesliga and they are currently fifth in the table, just four points behind fourth-placed Frankfurt.

They are likely to need more firepower if they are to maintain their challenge for a place in next year's Champions League and Pulisic would be a perfect addition to the squad.

#  Leon Goretzka set for Bayern Munich switch 

Germany international Leon Goretzka looks set to join Bayern Munich in the summer as his Schalke contract runs down.

Goretzka, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, is understood to have agreed a deal to join Bayern on a four-year contract.

The 22-year-old is one of Europe’s most highly rated young midfielders and has been linked with a number of top clubs in recent months.

But he looks set to join Bayern, who are determined not to let him leave for free next year.

Goretzka has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Germany and helped them win the Confederations Cup last summer.

#  Borussia Dortmund keen on Atalanta’s Duvan Zapata

Borussia Dortmund are interested in signing Atalanta striker Duvan Zapata, according to reports in Italy.

Zapata has been in excellent form for Atalanta this season, scoring 16 goals in 29 appearances in all competitions.

The 27-year-old’s performances have caught the attention of several top clubs across Europe and Dortmund are leading the race to sign him.

Atalanta are unwilling to sell Zapata but they may be forced to cash in on him this summer if they fail to qualify for next season’s Champions League.

Dortmund are looking for a new striker after selling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal in January and Zapata is seen as a potential replacement.

The Colombian striker would be a welcome addition to the Dortmund squad and he would be keen on joining them.

Zapata is under contract with Atalanta until 2020 but he could be tempted by a move to Dortmund this summer.

#  Hoffenheim pull out of deal for Arsenal striker

Arsenal have been dealt a huge blow after Hoffenheim withdrew their offer for striker, Lucas Perez. The Spanish international has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Emirates and had been linked with a move away from the club all summer.

Several clubs had expressed an interest in signing Perez, but Hoffenheim appeared to be the most likely destination for the 28-year-old. However, the Bundesliga side have now pulled out of the deal, leaving Arsenal with no choice but to retain the player.

Perez joined Arsenal from Deportivo La Coruna last summer for a fee of £17 million and made 24 appearances in all competitions during his first season in England. However, he only started eight league games and was mainly used as a back-up option by Arsene Wenger.

With Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang both joining Arsenal this summer, Perez has found himself even further down the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium. And with just one year left on his contract, he is now likely to stay at Arsenal and try to force his way into the first-team squad.
