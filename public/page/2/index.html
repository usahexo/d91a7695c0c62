While Stephens’ motive is still unknown, some are speculating that he may have been using the gambling site as a way to launder money.</p>
<p>So what is an online gambling site, and what can you use them for?</p>
<p>An online gambling site is essentially a website where you can gamble on various games and activities, including casino games like blackjack and roulette, sports betting, and poker. These sites offer a variety of different ways to gamble, including real-money betting and free play options.</p>
<p>Online gambling sites can be a great way to enjoy some excitement and risk while you’re sitting at home, but they can also be used for more serious purposes. For example, many people use online gambling sites as a way to test out new strategies or make bets on sporting events they have knowledge about.</p>
<p>However, online gambling sites can also be used for less legitimate purposes. Some people use these sites as a way to launder money or engage in other illegal activities. So if you’re thinking about using an online gambling site, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved.</p>

<p>He does some research and decides that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bovada.lv">Bovada</a> is the right site for him. Bovada is well-known for its fair games, generous bonuses, and quick payouts.</p>

<h1 id="Steve’s-Used-a-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Steve’s-Used-a-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Steve’s Used a Gambling Site"></a>Steve’s Used a Gambling Site</h1><p>A few months ago, I needed to gamble and didn’t want to leave my house. So, I went online and found a great gambling site. The design was excellent, the games were fun, and the bonuses were good. I deposited some money and started playing.</p>
<p> Within minutes, I was up several hundred dollars. I kept playing and ended up winning over $1,000. It was an amazing experience and I was really happy with the site.</p>
<p>Recently, I needed to gamble again and decided to use the same site. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as well this time around. I lost all of my money within a few minutes.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what went wrong. Maybe the site had changed since the last time I played there or maybe I just wasn’t lucky this time around. But whatever the reason, it was a disappointing experience.</p>
<p>Despite my poor experience this time around, I still think that the site is a great place to gamble. If you’re looking for a good online gambling site, then I recommend giving this one a try.</p>

I had played poker and blackjack in casino’s before, but I was always intimidated by the thought of playing these games online. I was sure that the casinos had some sort of edge that would make it impossible for me to win. </p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, I quickly discovered that the gambling sites can be quite useful! Not only did I end up making a little bit of money, but I also had a lot of fun doing it. Here are a few reasons why online gambling can be a fun and profitable experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a lot of different games to choose from.</li>
<li>You can play from the comfort of your own home.</li>
<li>You can win real money!</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons why gambling sites are so popular. If you’re looking for a new way to have some fun and potentially make some money, then online gambling might be right for you!</p>
<h1 id="Steve’s-Gambling-Site-Strategy-Pays-Off"><a href="#Steve’s-Gambling-Site-Strategy-Pays-Off" class="headerlink" title="Steve’s Gambling Site Strategy Pays Off!"></a>Steve’s Gambling Site Strategy Pays Off!</h1><p>After much research and several failed attempts, Steve’s online gambling site strategy is finally profitable!</p>
<p>Since starting his online gambling site in early 2014, Steve has been tweaking and adjusting his strategy in an effort to make a profit. After many months of losses, he was about to give up, but then things turned around. In the past three months, his site has been profitable every month!</p>
<p>So how does Steve’s strategy work? Here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He only gambles on games where he has a statistical edge over the house. This includes blackjack, craps, and baccarat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He only bets small amounts at a time, typically no more than $10 per bet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He always bets the same amount on each game. This helps him stay disciplined and avoid making rash decisions based on emotion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He never gambles more than he can afford to lose. This is key to avoiding serious financial problems if things go wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these basic guidelines, Steve has been able to make a modest profit from online gambling. While it’s not enough to quit his day job, it’s enough to cover some of his monthly expenses. And who knows? With a little bit of luck, maybe he can turn this into a full-time business!</p>
<h1 id="How-Steve-Turned-Gambling-Sites-Into-A-Winning-Strategy"><a href="#How-Steve-Turned-Gambling-Sites-Into-A-Winning-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="How Steve Turned Gambling Sites Into A Winning Strategy!"></a>How Steve Turned Gambling Sites Into A Winning Strategy!</h1><p>A lot of people out there think gambling is a fool’s game. They couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, with the right strategy, you can turn gambling into a winning proposition.</p>
<p>And that’s what Steve did. He discovered a way to make money off of online gambling sites by using a very simple approach.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>First, Steve picks a reputable online gambling site with good odds. Then, he deposits some money into his account and starts playing.</p>
<p>Steve doesn’t bet on every hand; instead, he only bets when the odds are in his favor. This allows him to make money while minimizing his risk.</p>
<p>Steve has been using this strategy for years and it’s worked like a charm. He’s managed to turn his initial deposit into a small fortune - all without risking too much money in the process.</p>

In this article, we will take a look at how much money the MGM casino makes each year and what factors contribute to their success.</p>
<p>The MGM casino is a massive entertainment complex that features everything from gambling to concerts and shows. The casino is also home to some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The MGM casino makes billions of dollars each year, thanks in part to its iconic location on the Las Vegas Strip. The casino has also been consistently ranked as one of the most profitable casinos in the world.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that have contributed to the success of the MGM casino include its wide variety of gaming options, world-class amenities, and prime location on the Las Vegas Strip. The casino has also invested heavily in marketing and advertising, which has helped it attract new visitors and keep existing customers coming back for more.</p>
<h1 id="Monaco-Casinos-rake-in-over-2-5-billion-each-year"><a href="#Monaco-Casinos-rake-in-over-2-5-billion-each-year" class="headerlink" title="Monaco Casinos rake in over $2.5 billion each year"></a>Monaco Casinos rake in over $2.5 billion each year</h1><p>Casinos in Monaco have long been a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, thanks to the easy access to gambling as well as the Mediterranean climate. In fact, Monaco casinos rake in over $2.5 billion each year, making it one of the most profitable gambling destinations in the world.</p>
<p>The principality of Monaco is home to a number of world-renowned casinos, including the Monte Carlo Casino, the Café de Paris Casino, and the Sun Casino. These casinos are known for their luxurious surroundings and high-stakes games, which attract well-heeled gamblers from all over the world.</p>
<p>In recent years, Monaco has seen a decline in casino visits from French nationals, who make up the majority of its clientele. This is likely due to France’s recent crackdown on gambling, which has made it more difficult for people to gamble in their home country. As a result, casinos in Monaco are now increasingly targeting Asian gamblers, who are believed to be more willing to spend big on gambling activities.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo Casino is by far the most popular casino in Monaco, with over two million visitors each year. This casino is particularly well-known for its high- stakes tables games, where players can bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single hand of blackjack or baccarat.</p>
<p>In addition to its world-famous casinos, Monaco is also known for its luxury hotels and resorts. The most famous of these is the Hotel de Paris Monte Carlo, which is located right next door to the Monte Carlo Casino. This hotel is known for its opulent décor and its celebrity clientele.</p>
<h1 id="The-Monte-Carlo-Casino-is-a-Millionaire-Factory"><a href="#The-Monte-Carlo-Casino-is-a-Millionaire-Factory" class="headerlink" title="The Monte Carlo Casino is a Millionaire Factory"></a>The Monte Carlo Casino is a Millionaire Factory</h1><p>The Monte Carlo Casino is the place to be for high rollers and millionaires. This casino is a millionaire factory, thanks to its many games that offer huge payouts. If you’re looking to make some serious money, the Monte Carlo Casino is the place to be.</p>
<p>Some of the games that offer the biggest payouts at this casino include blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. In blackjack, for example, you can win up to 1,500 times your original bet. This makes it one of the most lucrative games in the casino.</p>
<p>Roulette is another game that offers big payouts. In fact, there are several different ways to win big on this game. You can hit a single number and win 35-1, or you can hit a triple zero and win £350! Baccarat is also a game with high potential payouts. If you bet on the banker, you can win up to 95% of the time. This makes it a very safe bet, and one that could lead to some big profits.</p>
<p>Of course, you don’t have to be a high roller to enjoy the Monte Carlo Casino. All of its games are open to everyone, and there are plenty of smaller jackpots to be won. So whether you’re looking for a chance to become a millionaire or just want some excitement and entertainment, the Monte Carlo Casino has something for everyone.</p>

<p>Getting started at the Diamond Casino is simple. Just approach one of the many attendants stationed throughout the complex and purchase some chips. Then it’s off to the tables! The casino floor is packed with players eager to make some serious money, but don’t let that intimidate you – just remember to play smart and use your head.</p>
<p>If you’re new to gambling, it’s a good idea to start by playing the games with lower stakes. That way, you can learn the ropes without risking too much money. As you gain experience and confidence, you can gradually increase your betting amounts until you’re ready to take on the high rollers.</p>
<p>Just like in any other casino, blackjack is one of the most popular games at the Diamond Resort. The basic premise is simple: try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand. Be careful though, as sticking too closely to basic strategy can often lead to dismal results. Instead, try adopting a more aggressive playing style that suits your own personality.</p>
<p>Roulette is another beloved classic that’s always a hit at casinos around the world. In this game, players bet on whether a particular number or range of numbers will come up when the ball lands in one of the numbered slots on the wheel. There are all sorts of betting options available, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before sitting down at a table.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling lucky, give craps a shot. This exciting game involves betting on dice rolls, making for some truly nail-biting action. Just remember that don’t go over 21 – anything above that number results in an instant loss!</p>
<p>Whatever your chosen game, always remember to gamble responsibly and have fun!</p>

<h1 id="Get-your-Chip-and-Dip-at-the-Casino-Poker-Table"><a href="#Get-your-Chip-and-Dip-at-the-Casino-Poker-Table" class="headerlink" title="Get your Chip and Dip at the Casino Poker Table!"></a>Get your Chip and Dip at the Casino Poker Table!</h1><p>Chip and Dip is a casino poker table game that can be found in many of the popular casinos. The game is easy to play and can be enjoyed by players of all levels. The basic premise of the game is to bet on whether or not the next card dealt will be higher or lower than the current card.</p>
<h2 id="Betting"><a href="#Betting" class="headerlink" title="Betting"></a>Betting</h2><p>The game begins when the player places a bet. After the first card has been dealt, they may place an additional bet if they believe that the next card will be higher or lower than the first. The betting continues in this manner until either the player loses or decides to stop betting.</p>
<h2 id="Winning"><a href="#Winning" class="headerlink" title="Winning"></a>Winning</h2><p>If the player correctly guesses whether or not the next card will be higher or lower than the current card, then they win their bets multiplied by the odds shown on the table. For example, if a player bets $5 and wins with a correctly guessed high card, they would earn $25 ($5 x 5 = 25).</p>
<h1 id="Who-Needs-to-Roulette-When-You-Can-Have-Poker-Chips-and-Potato-Chips"><a href="#Who-Needs-to-Roulette-When-You-Can-Have-Poker-Chips-and-Potato-Chips" class="headerlink" title="Who Needs to Roulette When You Can Have Poker Chips and Potato Chips?"></a>Who Needs to Roulette When You Can Have Poker Chips and Potato Chips?</h1><p>The next time you feel like spinning the wheel, consider playing poker with your buddies. Poker is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their experience in casino games. And, if you’re looking for a reason to ditch the traditional blackjack and roulette tables, just think about how much fun poker can be with a plate of your favorite potato chips.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the basics of poker. In poker, players are dealt five cards each and are then required to make the best hand possible using any combination of those five cards. The player who has the best hand at the end of the game wins. Poker can be played with anywhere from two to 10 players, making it the perfect game for any get-together.</p>
<p>Now that we know a little bit about poker, let’s move on to some of the reasons why this card game is so much fun. For starters, poker is a great way to socialize and catch up with friends. The game moves quickly and there’s always something exciting happening – no one wants to miss out on the action! What’s more, poker offers plenty of opportunities for betting and raising, which only adds to the suspense and excitement of the game.</p>
<p>And if that wasn’t enough, poker players also have the chance to win some serious money. While it’s certainly not necessary to bet large sums of money in order to enjoy poker, there’s nothing quite like winning a big pot.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Grab some friends and some potato chips and start playing some Texas Hold ‘Em!</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Chips-That-Taste-Like-Potato-Chips-The-Ultimate-Gambling-Experience"><a href="#Poker-Chips-That-Taste-Like-Potato-Chips-The-Ultimate-Gambling-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Poker Chips That Taste Like Potato Chips - The Ultimate Gambling Experience!"></a>Poker Chips That Taste Like Potato Chips - The Ultimate Gambling Experience!</h1><p>As a gambler, you’re always looking for new and exciting ways to spice up your game. Well, look no further, because poker chips that taste like potato chips are the next big thing!</p>
<p>Here’s how they work: at the beginning of each game, everyone is given a set number of poker chips that taste like potato chips. These chips are just like any other poker chip, except that they have a delicious potato chip flavor.</p>
<p>When it comes time to bet, you can either bet with regular poker chips, or you can bet with your potato chip poker chips. If you lose the hand, you have to give up your potato chip poker chips to the winner. But if you win, the player who loses has to give you their regular poker chips.</p>
<p>So why would anyone want to play with regular poker chips when they could be playing with potato chip poker chips? The answer is simple - because you can’t win unless you’re betting with regular poker chips!</p>
<p>This creates an interesting dynamic between players. On the one hand, everyone wants to get their hands on as many potato chip poker chips as possible. On the other hand, no one wants to risk losing their regular poker chips.</p>
<p>This adds an extra level of excitement and anticipation to every hand. Will someone try to bluff with their potato chip poker chips? Or will they wait until they have a good hand before betting? There’s only one way to find out!</p>

If you’re lucky enough to win at a casino, you likely want to take that money and run, but you can’t just leave - you have to exchange your chips for cash first.</p>
<p>Casino staff are usually happy to help patrons exchange their chips for cash, but there are a few things you need to know in order to make the process as smooth as possible. Here’s what you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wait until you’ve won before cashing out. Casinos usually require players to wait until they’ve cleared their bets before cashing out, so try not to spend any of your winnings until you’re ready to go.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to the cashier’s cage. This is where you’ll exchange your chips for cash. Be sure to have your ID ready, as casinos often require it when cashing out large sums of money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exchange your chips for cash. This is pretty self-explanatory - just hand over your chips and receive your cash in return. Be sure to count your money carefully before leaving the casino!</p>

The redemption center will process the ticket and pay out the winnings. Winnings are paid as a lump sum, so it is important to bring the ticket with you when you go to collect them.</p>
<p>The payout amount for a winning ticket varies depending on the denomination of the ticket and the location where it was purchased. Generally, the larger the ticket, the higher the payout. However, there are no guarantees and each individual casino sets its own payout rates.</p>
<p>Some slot machines offer tickets that can be redeemed for merchandise or food instead of cash. These tickets may have a lower payout than traditional tickets, but they come with added benefits such as being able to choose from a wider range of merchandise or getting discounts on food purchases.</p>
<p>When cashing in a slot machine ticket, be sure to have your ID ready. This is because casino staff may need to verify your identity in order to pay out your winnings.</p>
<h1 id="Where-to-Cash-in-Slot-Machine-Tickets-for-Real-Money"><a href="#Where-to-Cash-in-Slot-Machine-Tickets-for-Real-Money" class="headerlink" title="Where to Cash in Slot Machine Tickets for Real Money"></a>Where to Cash in Slot Machine Tickets for Real Money</h1><p>When you play slot machines, you may be given tickets as you play. If so, you may be wondering what to do with them. Here is a guide to where to cash in slot machine tickets for real money.</p>
<p>The first place to go is usually the casino where the machines are located. Some casinos have kiosks set up specifically for this purpose. Others will have a desk or a window where you can turn in your tickets and receive your payout.</p>
<p>If the casino doesn’t offer this service, there are other ways to cash in your tickets. Many casinos partner with third-party companies that will exchange your tickets for cash. Simply take your tickets to one of these companies and they will give you a payout based on the current value of the tickets.</p>
<p>Finally, if you don’t want to go through the hassle of cashing in your tickets yourself, you can always sell them online. There are a number of websites that will buy your tickets from you for a percentage of their face value. This is a good option if you live far from a casino or if the casino’s payout rates are low.</p>
<p>No matter what method you choose, it’s important to remember that not all slot machine tickets are created equal. Some are worth more than others, so it’s important to do your research before cashing them in. Use this guide as a starting point, and consult additional sources like online forums and ticket exchange websites to get the most accurate information possible.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-Paid-for-Slot-Machine-Wins"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-for-Slot-Machine-Wins" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid for Slot Machine Wins"></a>How to Get Paid for Slot Machine Wins</h1><p>If you enjoy playing slot machines and you’re lucky enough to win on a regular basis, there are ways to get paid for your wins. In most cases, the casino will payout your winnings in the form of a voucher which can be exchanged for cash at the cage. However, some casinos may also pay out in cash.</p>
<p>Before heading to the casino to try and cash in on your winning streak, it’s important to know the payout policy of that particular establishment. Some casinos have different payout policies for different games, so be sure to ask what the policy is for slot machines.</p>
<p>Another thing you’ll want to ask about is the minimum and maximum payouts. This will give you an idea of how much money you could potentially win while playing at that casino. Keep in mind that most casinos have a higher payout percentage on their slot machines than what you would find at a typical bank or credit union.</p>
<p>So, how do you go about cashing in on your slot machine wins? </p>
<p>The first step is to present your voucher or ticket to the cage supervisor and request payment. In some cases, the supervisor may ask to see your ID before handing over your money. Once you have your cash, you can either leave the casino or continue gambling with whatever money you have left over.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that not all casinos offer cash payouts for slot machine wins. In fact, many casinos only offer vouchers which can only be redeemed at the casino itself. If this is the case, you’ll need to take whatever winnings you earn while playing slots and exchange them for cash at the cage. This can be a bit inconvenient if you’re not near the casino, but it’s still better than not getting paid at all.</p>
<p>So, if you love playing slots and happen to be lucky enough to win on a regular basis, be sure to familiarize yourself with the payout policies of local casinos. That way, you’ll know exactly what to expect when trying to collect your winnings.</p>

        <h1 id="Five-Bundesliga-clubs-interested-in-signing-Manchester-City-striker"><a href="#Five-Bundesliga-clubs-interested-in-signing-Manchester-City-striker" class="headerlink" title="Five Bundesliga clubs interested in signing Manchester City striker"></a>Five Bundesliga clubs interested in signing Manchester City striker</h1><p>Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim, Borussia Monchengladbach and Wolfsburg are all interested in signing Manchester City striker Leroy Sane this summer, according to reports.</p>
<p>Sane had a disappointing season at Manchester City last year, scoring just nine goals in all competitions. Pep Guardiola is believed to be willing to let the German international leave this summer, and it now looks like he could be on his way to the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Dortmund are believed to be leading the race for Sane’s signature, but they face competition from the other German clubs. RB Leipzig are also believed to be keen on signing him, while Hoffenheim and Monchengladbach are both interested in taking him on loan for next season.</p>
<p>Wolfsburg are the only club in the Bundesliga who can afford to sign Sane outright, but they may not want to pay his £135 million price tag.</p>
<p>Manchester City are likely to want to recoup most of the £37 million they paid Schalke for Sane two years ago, so any deal is likely to be in the region of £30-35 million.</p>
<h1 id="RB-Leipzig-want-to-bring-in-£30-million-rated-winger"><a href="#RB-Leipzig-want-to-bring-in-£30-million-rated-winger" class="headerlink" title="RB Leipzig want to bring in £30 million rated winger"></a>RB Leipzig want to bring in £30 million rated winger</h1><p>RB Leipzig are keen to bring in £30 million rated winger Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund, according to reports.</p>
<p>Pulisic is one of the most highly rated young players in Europe and has been linked with a number of top clubs in the past.</p>
<p>However, it looks like RB Leipzig are currently leading the race to sign him and they are willing to pay up to £30 million for his services.</p>
<p>Dortmund are likely to be reluctant to sell one of their prized assets, but they may be forced to cash in if an offer of around £30 million is made.</p>
<p>Pulisic has already shown that he is capable of playing at the highest level, having scored five goals and provided six assists in 19 appearances for Dortmund this season.</p>
<p>He also has three goals in six caps for the United States national team and looks destined for a bright future.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig have impressed in their first season in the Bundesliga and they are currently fifth in the table, just four points behind fourth-placed Frankfurt.</p>
<p>They are likely to need more firepower if they are to maintain their challenge for a place in next year’s Champions League and Pulisic would be a perfect addition to the squad.</p>
<h1 id="Leon-Goretzka-set-for-Bayern-Munich-switch"><a href="#Leon-Goretzka-set-for-Bayern-Munich-switch" class="headerlink" title="Leon Goretzka set for Bayern Munich switch"></a>Leon Goretzka set for Bayern Munich switch</h1><p>Germany international Leon Goretzka looks set to join Bayern Munich in the summer as his Schalke contract runs down.</p>
<p>Goretzka, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, is understood to have agreed a deal to join Bayern on a four-year contract.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old is one of Europe’s most highly rated young midfielders and has been linked with a number of top clubs in recent months.</p>
<p>But he looks set to join Bayern, who are determined not to let him leave for free next year.</p>
<p>Goretzka has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Germany and helped them win the Confederations Cup last summer.</p>
<h1 id="Borussia-Dortmund-keen-on-Atalanta’s-Duvan-Zapata"><a href="#Borussia-Dortmund-keen-on-Atalanta’s-Duvan-Zapata" class="headerlink" title="Borussia Dortmund keen on Atalanta’s Duvan Zapata"></a>Borussia Dortmund keen on Atalanta’s Duvan Zapata</h1><p>Borussia Dortmund are interested in signing Atalanta striker Duvan Zapata, according to reports in Italy.</p>
<p>Zapata has been in excellent form for Atalanta this season, scoring 16 goals in 29 appearances in all competitions.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old’s performances have caught the attention of several top clubs across Europe and Dortmund are leading the race to sign him.</p>
<p>Atalanta are unwilling to sell Zapata but they may be forced to cash in on him this summer if they fail to qualify for next season’s Champions League.</p>
<p>Dortmund are looking for a new striker after selling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal in January and Zapata is seen as a potential replacement.</p>
<p>The Colombian striker would be a welcome addition to the Dortmund squad and he would be keen on joining them.</p>
<p>Zapata is under contract with Atalanta until 2020 but he could be tempted by a move to Dortmund this summer.</p>
<h1 id="Hoffenheim-pull-out-of-deal-for-Arsenal-striker"><a href="#Hoffenheim-pull-out-of-deal-for-Arsenal-striker" class="headerlink" title="Hoffenheim pull out of deal for Arsenal striker"></a>Hoffenheim pull out of deal for Arsenal striker</h1><p>Arsenal have been dealt a huge blow after Hoffenheim withdrew their offer for striker, Lucas Perez. The Spanish international has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Emirates and had been linked with a move away from the club all summer.</p>
<p>Several clubs had expressed an interest in signing Perez, but Hoffenheim appeared to be the most likely destination for the 28-year-old. However, the Bundesliga side have now pulled out of the deal, leaving Arsenal with no choice but to retain the player.</p>
<p>Perez joined Arsenal from Deportivo La Coruna last summer for a fee of £17 million and made 24 appearances in all competitions during his first season in England. However, he only started eight league games and was mainly used as a back-up option by Arsene Wenger.</p>
<p>With Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang both joining Arsenal this summer, Perez has found himself even further down the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium. And with just one year left on his contract, he is now likely to stay at Arsenal and try to force his way into the first-team squad.</p>
