        <h1 id="How-to-Play-Fortuna"><a href="#How-to-Play-Fortuna" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Fortuna?"></a>How to Play Fortuna?</h1><p>Fortuna is a popular casino game that can be played in a variety of ways. In this article, we will discuss how to play the game and some of the strategies you can use to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basic-Rules-of-Fortuna"><a href="#The-Basic-Rules-of-Fortuna" class="headerlink" title="The Basic Rules of Fortuna"></a>The Basic Rules of Fortuna</h1><p>The basic rules are quite simple. The player is dealt two cards and then has the option to hold or discard one of them. The discarded card is replaced with another card from the deck and the resulting hand is compared to the dealer’s hand. If the player’s hand is higher than the dealer’s, they win; if it is lower, they lose. In addition, a bonus payout is awarded if the player’s hand contains a certain combination of cards (as shown in the table below).</p>
<p>Hand Type Payout Royal Flush 1000-to-1 Straight Flush 200-to-1 Four of a Kind 50-to-1 Full House 11-to-1 Flush 8-to-1 Straight 5-to-1 Three of a Kind 3-to-1 Two Pairs 2-to-1 One Pair 1-to-1 Ace/King or Ace/Queen 0.5/0.5</p>
<p>There are also several side bets that can be placed on different hands. We will not discuss these in detail here, but you can find more information on our website.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Fortuna-1"><a href="#How-to-Play-Fortuna-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Fortuna?"></a>How to Play Fortuna?</h1><p>The basic strategy for playing Fortuna is to always keep any pair or better, and then hit on any other hand. For example, if you are dealt K♥ Q♦, you would keep the Queen and hit on the King. This strategy gives you a probability of winning 53%. However, there are several other strategies that can be used depending on your style of play. You can find more information on our website.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Winning-at-Fortuna"><a href="#Tips-for-Winning-at-Fortuna" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Winning at Fortuna"></a>Tips for Winning at Fortuna</h1><p>Here are a few tips to help you win at Fortuna:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t overbet - betting too much can quickly lead to ruin if you lose. Keep your bets reasonable and within your budget.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Use basic strategy - following basic strategy gives you the best chance of winning against the dealer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when to fold - if your hand isn’t good enough to beat the dealer, it’s better to fold and save your money than risk losing it all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plan your betting patterns - try not to bet too much on any one hand, Instead spread your bets out so that you still have money left if you do happen to lose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient - gambling is supposed to be fun, so don’t rush into making rash decisions. Take your time and make sure you are comfortable with the game before placing any bets</p>

<p>Since 2007, Sky Deutschland has had exclusive broadcasting rights for the Bundesliga in Germany. This means that no other broadcaster may air live matches or highlights of any Bundesligacompetition games on television or radio.

This will allow Amazon Prime members to watch all live and exclusive matches of the German Bundesliga on their platform.</p>
<p>In order to watch Amazon Prime’s coverage of the Bundesliga, you must be a resident of one of these countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden or Switzerland. If you are not a resident of one of these countries but have an Amazon Prime account that is registered in one of these countries, then you will be able to watch the games as well. If you do not have an Amazon Prime account but would like to purchase one so that you can watch the games live and Exclusive on your platform, then click here for a free trial of Amazon Prime.</p>
