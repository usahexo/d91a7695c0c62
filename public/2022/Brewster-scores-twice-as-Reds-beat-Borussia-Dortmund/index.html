<p>Brewster scores twice as Reds beat Borussia Dortmund</p>
<p>Liverpool 2-1 Borussia Dortmund</p>
<p>Anfield, Liverpool</p>
<p>Saturday, September 14, 2019</p>
<p>Liverpool continued their unbeaten start to the season with a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on Saturday. The Reds were made to work hard for the three points, but teenager Rhian Brewster’s two goals gave them all three points.</p>
<p>Dortmund started the game brightly and had a series of chances in the first few minutes. However, it was Liverpool who took the lead in the 17th minute when Brewster finished off a well-worked move. The German side continued to push for an equalizer and they got it in the 42nd minute when Mats Hummels headed home from a corner.</p>
<p>The second half was more even, with both sides having chances to take the lead. It was Brewster who scored the winner in the 67th minute, netting his second goal of the game after a mistake from goalkeeper Roman Burki. The win moves Liverpool up to second in the Premier League table, behind Manchester City on goal difference.</p>
<h1 id="Champions-League-football-returns-to-Anfield"><a href="#Champions-League-football-returns-to-Anfield" class="headerlink" title="Champions League football returns to Anfield"></a>Champions League football returns to Anfield</h1><p>Liverpool FC will host AS Roma on Tuesday, April 24 in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal. The match is one of the most highly anticipated European games to be played at Anfield in recent memory.</p>
<p>Liverpool enter the semifinal after eliminating Manchester City in thrilling fashion. Trailing 0-3 from the first leg, Liverpool mounted a stunning comeback to win the second leg 4-3 and advance to the semifinals on aggregate. Mohamed Salah was the hero, scoring two goals in addition to assists on two other goals.</p>
<p>Roma, meanwhile, defeated Barcelona in perhaps the biggest upset of this year’s Champions League. Roma won 3-0 in the first leg of their quarterfinal matchup against Barcelona before holding on for a 4-4 draw in the return leg, advancing 7-5 on aggregate.</p>
<p>The two clubs have met six times in European competition, with Liverpool winning three times and Roma winning twice. The most recent meeting between the clubs came in the 1984-85 European Cup semifinal, which Liverpool won 2-1 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Both clubs are led by impressive attacking players. For Liverpool, Mohamed Salah has been arguably the best player in Europe this season, scoring 43 goals in all competitions. He will be supported by Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, who have also enjoyed successful seasons. Roma’s attack is headlined by Edin Dzeko and Diego Perotti, both of whom have scored over 20 goals this season.</p>
<p>This semifinal matchup is sure to be exciting and unpredictable. Both clubs have shown they are capable of playing spectacular football and scoring goals. Whoever wins will have a tough task ahead of them in the final to take home Europe’s top prize.</p>
<h1 id="Klopp’s-side-keen-to-make-up-for-early-exit-last-season"><a href="#Klopp’s-side-keen-to-make-up-for-early-exit-last-season" class="headerlink" title="Klopp’s side keen to make up for early exit last season"></a>Klopp’s side keen to make up for early exit last season</h1><p>Liverpool will be keen to make up for their early exit from the Champions League last season as they enter the competition this year.</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s side were knocked out of Europe at the group stage last year, despite being heavy favourites to progress. This year, they will be looking to make a much better impression in the competition and potentially go all the way.</p>
<p>The Reds have been handed a favourable draw, with matches against Napoli, Paris Saint-Germain and Red Star Belgrade in Group C. They will be confident of progressing to the next round, and anything less than a place in the knockout stages would be seen as a disappointment.</p>
<p>Liverpool have made a strong start to the new Premier League season, winning all four of their matches so far. They will now switch their focus to the Champions League, and will be aiming to make a good impression in Europe’s top club competition.</p>
<h1 id="Bayern-Munich-expected-to-win-but-anything-could-happen-in-group-stage"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-expected-to-win-but-anything-could-happen-in-group-stage" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich expected to win but anything could happen in group stage"></a>Bayern Munich expected to win but anything could happen in group stage</h1><p>The group stage of the UEFA Champions League is set to begin next week and all eyes will be on Bayern Munich as they are expected to steamroll their opponents and make it to the knockout stage. However, there are a few potential banana peels in their path that could trip them up.</p>
<p>First and foremost is their opening match against Benfica. The Portuguese side has some very dangerous players, most notably Gonçalo Guedes, who scored a hat-trick against Monaco in the playoffs. If Bayern underestimate them, they could easily find themselves losing the opener.</p>
<p>Another team that could potentially give Bayern trouble is Besiktas. The Turkish side made it all the way to the quarterfinals last year and boast a number of dangerous attackers, including Cenk Tosun and Ricardo Quaresma. They are sure to give Bayern a tough match and could potentially pull off an upset.</p>
<p>Overall, Bayern should have no trouble making it out of the group stage, but they cannot take any of their opponents lightly. There are always surprises in European football and anything could happen on any given night.</p>
<h1 id="Liverpool-could-benefit-from-tough-group-with-potential-for-progress"><a href="#Liverpool-could-benefit-from-tough-group-with-potential-for-progress" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool could benefit from tough group with potential for progress"></a>Liverpool could benefit from tough group with potential for progress</h1><p>After Liverpool’s fourth-placed finish in the Premier League last season, they were handed a favourable group for this year’s Europa League campaign. Jurgen Klopp’s side have been drawn against Rubin Kazan, Bordeaux and Sion in Group B.</p>
<p>The Reds will be looking to progress to the knockout stages of the competition after exiting at the last-16 stage last year. However, they could benefit from a tough group with potential for progress.</p>
<p>Liverpool will be favourites to win their group, but they cannot take their opponents lightly. Rubin Kazan finished third in the Russian Premier League last season, while Bordeaux are regulars in European competitions. Sion are also experienced campaigners in Europe, having reached the group stages of the Europa League on three occasions.</p>
<p>If Liverpool can get off to a good start in their group, it could give them the momentum they need to progress further in the competition. They will be looking to improve on last year’s performance, when they were knocked out by Besiktas.</p>
